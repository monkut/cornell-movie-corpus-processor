# cornell-movie-corpus-processor
Intended to be a corpus processor for building a chatbot based on the cornell movie corpus.

This processes the [Cornell Movie Dialog Corpus](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html) for use with training a chatbot.

My attempt to understand what this script is doing in it's preparation of data for building a tensorflow chatbot.
